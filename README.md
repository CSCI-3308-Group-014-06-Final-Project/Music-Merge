# Music-Merge
**“For our music enthusiasts around the world, our vision is to revolutionize the way people curate and enjoy their playlists and have something of their own that expresses both parties. Our goal is to seamlessly merge their playlists, and have a dynamic and personalized music experience.”**

One big issue with many modern music streaming platforms is the ability to merge two playlists into one. Our application will allow the user to look at their playlist library and select two playlists that they would like to combine. 

Our application will have the ability to merge multiple Spotify playlists into one playlist that the user can stream from spotify.
